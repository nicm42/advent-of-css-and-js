## General info

This is from Advent of CSS/JS day 1.

Brief:
Users should be able to:

- Start and Stop the Timer
- Click on the gear icon to change the length (minutes and seconds) for the timer.

And it should look like the Figma design given.

> For the CSS I tried out alphabetical ordering.

> For the JS I tried out Alpine JS.
